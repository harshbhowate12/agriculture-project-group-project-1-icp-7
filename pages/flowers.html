        <p class="various_produts_info"> <b>Flowering plants produce seeds that are then dispersed from their parent. When a seed
            comes to rest in an appropriate place with conditions suitable to its germination, it breaks open. The
            embryo inside the seed starts to grow into a seedling. Roots grow down to anchor the plant in the ground.
            Roots also take up water and nutrients and store food. A shoot grows skywards and develops into a stem that
            carries water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant. The stem also supports leaves so they
            can collect sunlight. Leaves capture sunlight to make energy for the plant through the process of
            photosynthesis.</b></p>
