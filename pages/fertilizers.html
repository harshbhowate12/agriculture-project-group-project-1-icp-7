        <p class="various_produts_info"> <b>Fertilizer, natural or artificial substance containing the chemical elements
            that improve growth and productiveness of plants. Fertilizers enhance the natural fertility of the soil or
            replace chemical elements taken from the soil by previous crops.Soil fertility is the quality of a soil that
            enables it to provide compounds in adequate amounts and proper balance to promote growth of plants when
            other factors (such as light, moisture, temperature, and soil structure) are favourable. Where fertility of
            the soil is not good, natural or manufactured materials may be added to supply the needed plant nutrients.</b></p>
